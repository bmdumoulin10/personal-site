                        My love for coding dates back to my sophomore year of college at the University of New Hampshire, although at the time it was not part of my life plan. I randomly took a computer science course as a general education class even though it was not recommended by my peers as one of the easy classes to take. The class was just an introduction to HTML, but quickly became my favorite class at the time.

                        Throughout the class we learned basic HTML structure and how to make a static page. Our final project was to create a website that had at least 5 pages within it. I decided to make a website for my club ice hockey team from that year that contained our team picture, roster, statistics, schedule, and standings. This was a large task for having very little exposure and having other classwork to complete, but I remember spending numerous hours tinkering around with this project to make it look cool. (All my styles were done inline in the HTML at that point as we did not learn CSS.) Nonetheless, even though my site was basic, I felt accomplished at the end and was happy with what I was able to create.

                       8 years after this class I found myself unhappy with my career and looking for change. I needed to find work that I wanted to do and had a passion for. Thinking back, I remembered loving my graphic design classes in high school and almost going to college for it in the first place. Also, I thought back to the introduction to HTML class I took in college and decided that I needed to look into this possibility more. After much research, I came to the conclusion that I was going to go back to school and learn to code.

                       Trying to go back to school is not easy after 6 years of being out of school but I was determined to do something I enjoyed. I decided to take online classes through Southern New Hampshire University to work towards a BS in Information Technology: Web Development and Design and began taking 1-2 classes every 8 weeks on top of working 40-50 hours per week. After 1 year of taking the classes online, I felt that I was not getting as much out of it as I wanted to and started to look at coding boot camps in the Denver area since that is what I wanted to do, CODE.

                      I decided to attend RefactorU in Boulder, CO which is a 10-week immersive full stack web development boot camp. At RefactorU, I worked through over 400 hours of hands on coding while utilizing the JavaScript based MEAN Stack that consists of MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and node.js. At the conclusion of this boot camp I built from scratch and deployed my project called MyPantry. I use this application regularly to find new recipes to make at home and could not be happier with the outcome. Feel free to check it out for yourself as there is a link to it in the projects section of this site.

                      I am currently continuing to build web applications and sites with the skills I now have on a daily basis and love every second of it. I not only enjoy utilizing the MEAN stack, but am interested in learning other languages and libraries so I can continue to grow in my new and exciting career. The amount of knowledge I now have after just 10 weeks of study is incredible and I continue to think about how much more I will know in another 10 weeks, and another. As I continue my journey and complete the projects I am working on I will update my projects page for everyone to enjoy.
