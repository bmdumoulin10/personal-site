                         Ladies and gentleman there is about to be a new cycle/spin studio in Denver, CO. High Ride Cycle is hoping to open its doors in the upcoming months and had reached out to me to build their website. This was an exciting opportunity and I jumped all over it. Owners Scott and Megan Hanson were great to work with and after some back and forth we agreed on a great layout and design for them. Today, we deployed the new site which can be accessed through my Projects page. Take a look to check out how version 1.0 of the site looks. As the next few weeks move on we will be working to decide on a mobile layout, and then I will be building a custom content manager for them to log in and be able to change the content whenever they need to. Keep checking in on the site to see when you can attend one of their high energy classes!

                         (12/15/16) I am excited to announce that I have accepted an offer to work for RSM US LLP as their newest Application Developer. As an Application Developer for RSM US LLP I will be focused on working with clients who use NetSuite software for their business needs. My role is to learn their business, and their needs, so I can customize their NetSuite software. NetSuite can be customized using JavaScript, and even utilizes their own API known as SuiteScript. This is an exciting opportunity to become a team member of such a great company. I am looking forward to learning new techniques and honing in on my new craft, but still enjoy working on other projects in my spare time.

                         After some back and forth we have come up with a style and layout for the latest Beachbody project. I am working with the client in order to get the exact pictures and full content they want, but we are well on our way to a beautiful website that this amazing Beachbody coach can be proud of! UPDATE: This website was put on hold for the time being, but is all there to be completed once the final details are decided on by the client.

                        (8/4/16) I have a new project that I am about to start! As many of you may know Beachbody is a home workout and fitness supplement company that inspires people to live healthy and help others live healthy. A Beachbody coach has approached me about making her a website to promote her Beachbody business. I will be having a meeting with her about the direction she wants to go with her site and getting the work underway. As soon as the project is done, a link and description will be added to the projects page. <br><br>
                        If you or anyone you know is in need for a quality website, please reach out and we can set up a time to discuss your vision. My contact information can be found in the About page.
